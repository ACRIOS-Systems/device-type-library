# Akenza Device Type Library

By default data is expected to be published on the default topic, the schema `schema.json` or `default.schema.json` specifies this. For a non-default topic use `<topic>.schema.json`.




## Open points

- Schema per topic in one file, use keywords?
- Allow wildcard topic, to define that it is output to every topic
- Add downlink sample
